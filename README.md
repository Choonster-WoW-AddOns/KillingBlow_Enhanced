Description
===========
KillingBlow_Enhanced is a WoW AddOn that shows an image and plays a sound when you get a killing blow.

At the moment, the AddOn is only available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Choonster/KillingBlow_Enhanced/); but it will be available from Curse and WoW Interface at a later date.

Installation
============
To install the AddOn from a downloaded and unzipped GitHub tarball, create a folder called **KillingBlowImage** in your **Interface\AddOns** folder and copy the downloaded files into it.
