Description
===========
Killing Blow Image is a WoW AddOn that shows an image and plays a sound when you get a killing blow.

At the moment, the AddOn is only available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Choonster/KillingBlowImage/); but it will be available from Curse and WoW Interface at a later date.
